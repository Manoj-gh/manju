# 🚀 Contentstack Launch Deployment

Your site works perfectly on localhost! Here's how to deploy to **Contentstack Launch**:

## 📦 Static Build Ready!

Your site has been built as static files in:
- `build/` directory - Ready for Contentstack Launch
- `dist/` directory - Backup static version

## 🎯 Deploy to Contentstack Launch:

### Step 1: Build Static Files
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Upload to Contentstack Launch
1. Go to your **Contentstack dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Launch** section
3. **Create new site** or **Update existing**
4. **Upload the `build/` folder contents**
5. Set **index.html** as entry point

## ✅ What Works on Contentstack Launch:
- ✅ All your HTML pages
- ✅ CSS styling and animations  
- ✅ JavaScript functionality
- ✅ Contentstack data integration (client-side)
- ✅ Image loading and cache-busting
- ✅ Clean URLs (without .html)

## ⚠️ Limitations vs Localhost:
- ❌ No Express.js server-side routing
- ❌ No server-side redirects
- ✅ But client-side Contentstack sync still works!

## 🔧 Files Ready for Launch:
```

│   ├── styles.css      # All optimizations
│   ├── script.js       # Animations
│   └── contentstack-sync.js  # CMS integration
└── [all other pages]
```

## 🌟 Your Optimizations Preserved:
